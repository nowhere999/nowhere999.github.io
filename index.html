                <li><strong>Bakugan Battle Brawler:</strong> 
                    Dan Kuso's life changes one day when strange cards fall out of the sky and he grabs one, which he and his friend Shun use to invent a game they call "Bakugan." With other friends, they formed a group called the "Bakugan Battle Brawlers." They are then accidentally dragged into fighting for the fate of Vestroia (the home dimension of the Bakugans)
Vestroia loses its natural balance and merges with the Earth and many other worlds. A rogue Bakugan called "Naga" has been tempted to capture the power of the Infinity and Silent Cores, which together formed the Perfect Core that balanced Vestroia, but Naga has absorbed too much negative energy and thus has been trapped within the Silent Core, destabilizing Vestroia. Naga now seeks the mighty Infinity Core so that he can complete the all-powerful Perfect Core and have absolute control over the Earth and Vestroia]</li>
                <li><strong>Bakugan Newvestroia:</strong>
                    Three years have passed by since the Brawlers defeated Naga and bid farewell to the Bakugan. Drago sacrificed his physical body to become the new Perfect Core, uniting the Bakugan's fractured homeworld and forming New Vestroia. However, aliens arrive on New Vestroia, and begin colonizing the Bakugan's home, unaware that the Bakugan are intelligent beings. The Bakugan are returned to their primitive ball forms. Upon the defeat of Tigrerra, the last of the Fighting Bakugan of the Battle Brawlers, Drago is freed from his role as the Core of Vestroia and seeks the help of Dan once again to help save his world.

However, he chooses to leave behind the rest of the Battle Brawlers (minus Alice and Shun, who are elsewhere), out of concern for their safety. Despite this, Marucho trails closely behind, leaving Runo and Julie behind. Upon arriving at New Vestroia, Dan and Marucho encounter three Vestals: Mira, Ace and Baron, members of the Bakugan Brawlers Resistance. Along the way, the brawlers reunite with Shun, who also joins the Resistance.

While battling against the evil Vexos, Vestal's top brawlers, who also serve the Vestal royal family, the Resistance manage to destroy each of the three Dimension Controllers that keep the Bakugan in their ball form, liberating New Vestroia. The Brawlers return to Earth, with the rest of the resistance returning back home to Vestal. They reassemble six months later when they learn that King Zenoheld of Vestal attacked the Six Ancient Warriors in an attempt to steal their Attribute Energies. The Six Ancient Warriors engaged in a 6-on-1 battle with Zenoheld, but were unable to defeat Zenoheld's Mechanical Bakugan, Farbros.

In desperation, the Ancient Warriors give the Resistance Bakugan their attribute energies to protect them from Zenoheld, who reveals the Bakugan Termination System, a machine built to wipe out all Bakugan, but requires the Attribute Energies now held by the Resistance's Bakugan to power it. These energies result in the six Bakugan evolving. After losing half the energies, the Brawlers decided to attack instead, engaging in a temporary alliance with Spectra Phantom, the former leader of the Vexos, along with his sidekick Gus Grav. However, the remaining energies are taken as the result of a trap field, and the Brawlers rush to New Vestroia to evacuate all the Bakugan. Drago, however, refuses to give up, and manages to destroy the BT System by absorbing all 6 Attribute Energies and evolves again into Helix Dragonoid.

Things quiet down briefly, until Spectra resurfaces again to battle Dan; upon losing, he concedes that Drago is the strongest Bakugan and joins the Brawlers, returning to his original self, Keith Fermin. Keith reveals that Zenoheld is working on a powerful weapon called the Alternative System and helps construct Battle Gear for Drago. Meanwhile, the Vexos begin crumbling from within as both Volt and Lync revolt, feeling that Zenoheld has crossed the line, but they are quickly disposed of by Prince Hydron. In the final battle, the Brawlers, Spectra, and Gus, manage to destroy the Alternative System, ending Zenoheld once and for all. With the Alternative crisis over, Dan, Shun, and Marucho bid farewell to the Resistance and returned to Earth. Weeks after, the trio were greeted by Ren Krawler, a Darkus Brawler from Gundalia. ]</li>
